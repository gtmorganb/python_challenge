# python_challenge
This homework was our first python homework and it definitely took up so much more time trying to figure out than did the VBA_homework. 

There two two different folders within this homework that hold different code and outcomes. 

The first set of data is called PyBank and it is about a company's financial records. They are very simplistic in nature (thank goodness) so the report is also simplistic in nature. 

The first calculation for PyBank was to find the total number of months for which the financial records were for. Then the code calculates the net total gain over those 86 months as well as the average change between months. Finally, the code calcuates the minimum and maximum values which corresponded to the months they occured in. These results can be found in the analysis1 file. 

The most challenging part of this dataset was calulcating the average change between each month. 

The second set of data is called PyPoll and contains election data. Within that dataset my code calculates the total amount of votes that were collected, the candidates names, the total votes per candidate, a percentage for each candidate, and the winner. All of these results can be seen in the analysis report in the folder.
